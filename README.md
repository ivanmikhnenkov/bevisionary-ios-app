# bevisionary-ios-app

This is the full "BeVisionary" project, which is iOS app for iPad with all visual and marketing materials. Version 1.0 first and final, because I've decided to switch into AI field instead of iOS development and stoped supporting BeVisionary.

The application was designed, developed and released by me alone from scratch during 9 months and released on August 31, 2018 on the App Store. 
It's got quite votes on producthunt platform: https://www.producthunt.com/posts/bevisionary 

Before BeVisionary development I taught myself both programming and developing for iOS from scratch specifically to create this app.

Everybody interested is welcomed to use whatever you like from this repository. Also, it can be useful to get the scope of work to make a complete application for App Store.
