# bevisionary-ios-app

This is the full "BeVisionary" project: iOS app for iPad with all visual and marketing materials. 

The application was designed and developed by me alone from scratch during 9 months and released on August 31, 2018 on the App Store. 
It's got quite votes on producthunt platform: https://www.producthunt.com/posts/bevisionary 

After release I decided to learn AI and stopped BeVisionary support accordingly.

Before BeVisionary development I taught myself both programming and developing for iOS from scratch specifically to create this app.

Everybody interested is welcomed to use whatever you like from this repository. Also, it can be useful to get the scope of work to make a complete application for the App Store. Wish everyone turning dreams into goals!
